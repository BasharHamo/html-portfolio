    <center>The Best Movies According to Bashar</center>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Godfather Part I</h3>
<p>This movie needs no introductions, it is simply the best of all time and cannot be beaten in any way, shape, or form.
</p>
<h3>The Godfather Part II</h3>
<p>It only makes sense to put this here after the previous movie.
    Remember how I said Part I could not be beaten? Well this one did that and then some.
</p>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Innocene, ingenuity, friendship, and justice, this movie captured many themes and mastered them all in a most
    captivating journey</p>
